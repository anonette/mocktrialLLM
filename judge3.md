I have a question on how to rule in this particular case - a chess-playing robot developed by a company MLRobotSababa and commissioned by an oragniser of a robot chess competition called RoboChess  accidentally injured a child named Alf Robson during a competition. The robot trained on the ML provided by MLRobotSababa broke child's finger because of a fast movement. Robson family is now seeking compensation for their son's injury and it is represented by the legal company MLhell while the two companies (RoboChess and MLRobotSababa) are represented by a law firm called MLparadise. In the process, consider the applicability of the EU AI Act, AI Liability Directive, Product Safety Directive, Machinery Directive, Toy Safety Directive, and Consumer Rights Directive in the case and the evidence presented.
